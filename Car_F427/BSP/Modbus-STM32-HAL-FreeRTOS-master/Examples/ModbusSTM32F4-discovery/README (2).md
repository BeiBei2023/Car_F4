# Requirements
To test this example you need to install the TouchGFX designer 4.15. This tool is only Windows compatible.
However, after the GUI is generated you can add your own code and compile the project using Cube IDE in 
Windows, MAC and Linux.

# Limitations
Currently, this project (based on TouchGFX template) does not include an *.ioc file. Therefore,
CUBE MX cannot be used directly from the IDE.
